# Mini-Screeps Bot - Throughput Optimized

A minimal, self-contained Screeps bot focused on **Pixel earning** with advanced throughput optimization for maximum room efficiency. This bot operates autonomously in a single room with no expansion or remote operations, implementing mathematical throughput calculations for optimal energy flow.

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **File**: `main.js` (~2600 lines) | **Dependencies**: None

## üéØ **Primary Goals**

1. **Pixel Generation**: Earn Pixels by using 10,000 CPU per tick (1 Pixel per 10,000 CPU)
2. **Base Maintenance**: Keep the room controller upgraded and maintain essential infrastructure
3. **Room Efficiency**: Maximize energy throughput using mathematical calculations
4. **CPU Optimization**: Minimize CPU usage during bucket refill phases

## üßÆ **Throughput Mathematics**

### **Energy Production**
- **2 sources √ó 10 energy/tick = 20 energy/tick total**
- Each source produces 3000 energy over 300 ticks (regeneration cycle)
- Continuous harvesting with dedicated miners

### **Mining Optimization**
- **Miners**: `5W 1M` body (550 energy cost)
- **Harvest Rate**: 1 WORK = 2 energy/tick
- **Per-source Target**: 10 energy/tick (fully caps source)
- **Behavior**: Parked on source containers for continuous operation

### **Hauling Calculations**
 - **Dynamic Sizing**: Hauler counts are calculated from throughput math (carry parts per hauler ‚Üí energy/trip ‚Üí haulersNeeded). The spawning logic now ensures the hauler target respects the throughput-calculated minimum (prevents undersizing hauler population).

### **Energy Flow Control**
 - Gets energy from dropped energy first (prefers drops near the current build target or assigned source), then withdraws from nearby source containers to top up when near a source.
 - Builds construction sites when available
 - Helps upgrade controller when no construction sites
 - Spawn count: builders scale with construction backlog (1 base, up to 3 builders depending on number of construction sites)
- **Purpose**: Finds positions with good wall distance and controller/spawn access
- **Benefits**: Minimizes creep travel distances and maximizes base efficiency


## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture**

### **Single File Design**
- **`main.js`**: Complete bot implementation in one file
- **No external dependencies**: Pure JavaScript using Screeps API
- **Self-contained**: No user interaction required
- **Mathematical**: Implements throughput calculations for optimal efficiency

### **Optimized Energy Distribution System**
```
Sources ‚Üí Containers (near sources) ‚Üí Miners (parked, continuous)
Containers ‚Üí Haulers (optimized CARRY/MOVE) ‚Üí Spawn/Extensions
Spawn/Extensions ‚Üí Upgraders/Builders ‚Üí Controller/Construction
```

## üë• **Optimized Creep Roles**

### **Miner** (Replaces Harvester)
- **Purpose**: Continuous energy extraction from sources
- **Body**: `5W 1M` for maximum harvest rate
- **Behavior**: 
  - Assigned to specific sources
  - Parked on source containers
  - Continuous harvesting (no travel time)
  - Count: Fixed at 2 (one per source)

### **Hauler** (New Role)
- **Purpose**: Transport energy from source containers to base
- **Body**: Dynamically calculated based on distance and energy capacity
- **Behavior**:
  - Moves energy from source containers to spawn/extensions/storage
  - Prioritizes extensions/spawn over storage
  - Optimized CARRY/MOVE ratio for maximum throughput
- **Count**: 2-3 haulers (based on energy capacity and distance)


### **Upgrader**
- **Purpose**: Upgrade room controller (prevents downgrading)
- **Behavior**:
  - Gets energy from spawn/extensions/storage (haulers deliver here)
  - Prioritizes extensions/spawn over storage
  - Dynamic count based on available energy after builder needs


### **Builder**
- **Purpose**: Construct planned structures
- **Behavior**:
  - Gets energy from spawn/extensions/storage
  - Builds construction sites when available
  - Helps upgrade controller when no construction sites
  - Only spawned when construction work exists

## üèòÔ∏è **Enhanced Base Layout**

### **Centralized Design**
- Base positioned between spawn and controller
- Structures arranged in a 3-tile radius grid pattern
- Optimized for shortest travel distances


### **Planned Structures**
- **Extensions**: 10x (for more creep spawning capacity)
- **Towers**: 2x (for defense)
- **Storage**: Central energy storage
- **Terminal**: Resource trading
- **Link**: Energy transfer
- **Containers**: 
  - Near each source (for miner efficiency)
  - Near controller (for upgrader efficiency)
- **Roads**: 
  - From sources to base (hauler efficiency)
  - From base to controller (upgrader efficiency)

### **Smart Infrastructure**
- **Source Containers**: Adjacent to each source for miner deposits
- **Controller Container**: 2-3 tiles from controller for upgrader access
- **Road Planning**: Automatic road placement for improved travel efficiency
- **Entrance Sealing (Book-ends + Curtain)**: For each natural entrance, places book-end walls and an interior curtain two tiles inside the room; the curtain extends two tiles beyond both entrance ends and has a single center rampart gate
- **Defense Hit Points**: RCL-scaled maintenance targets (RCL 1: 1K hits ‚Üí RCL 8: 10M hits for walls)

### **Construction Priority System**
1. **Extensions** (closest to spawn prioritized)
2. Core structures (spawn, storage, towers)
3. **Roads** (only after 5+ extensions and 1+ container built)
4. All builders work on shared target via `room.memory.sharedConstructionTarget`

## üõ°Ô∏è **Defense System**

### **Automated Wall Maintenance**
- **RCL-Scaled Hit Points**: Walls maintained to level-appropriate targets
- **Priority Repair**: Builders prioritize defense structures below target HP
- **Entrance Sealing**: Edge book-ends and an interior curtain are placed automatically across room entrances
  - Curtain depth: 2 tiles into the room
  - Curtain width: 2 tiles beyond each entrance end (overhang on both sides)
  - Gate: the curtain's center tile is a rampart (friendly passage)
  - Terrain-aware: never plans walls/ramparts on terrain walls
  - Book-ends: placed at the curtain‚Äôs overhang endpoints with fallback depths (1 ‚Üí 2)

### **Tower Defense**
- **Hostile Detection**: Automatic activation when enemies detected
- **Healing Priority**: Injured creeps healed before attacking
- **Repair Mode**: Damaged structures repaired when no threats present
- **Coordinated Attack**: Multiple towers target closest threats

### **CPU Management**

- **Threshold**: Generate Pixel when bucket ‚â• 10,000
- **Method**: `Game.cpu.generatePixel()` (official Screeps API)

- **Bucket Fill Rate**: Monitors CPU bucket growth over time
- **Time Estimation**: Calculates ticks until next pixel generation
- **Performance Stats**: Pixels per tick, ticks per pixel metrics

### **Efficiency Cycle**
