# Mini-Screeps Bot - Throughput Optimized

A minimal, self-contained Screeps bot focused on **Pixel earning** with advanced throughput optimization for maximum room efficiency. This bot operates autonomously in a single room with no expansion or remote operations, implementing mathematical throughput calculations for optimal energy flow.

## üéØ **Primary Goals**

1. **Pixel Generation**: Earn Pixels by using 10,000 CPU per tick (1 Pixel per 10,000 CPU)
2. **Base Maintenance**: Keep the room controller upgraded and maintain essential infrastructure
3. **Room Efficiency**: Maximize energy throughput using mathematical calculations
4. **CPU Optimization**: Minimize CPU usage during bucket refill phases

## üßÆ **Throughput Mathematics**

### **Energy Production**
- **2 sources √ó 10 energy/tick = 20 energy/tick total**
- Each source produces 3000 energy over 300 ticks (regeneration cycle)
- Continuous harvesting with dedicated miners

### **Mining Optimization**
- **Miners**: `5W 1M` body (550 energy cost)
- **Harvest Rate**: 1 WORK = 2 energy/tick
- **Per-source Target**: 10 energy/tick (fully caps source)
- **Behavior**: Parked on source containers for continuous operation

### **Hauling Calculations**
- **Formula**: `Trtt = 2d + 4` (round-trip time with roads)
- **CARRY Requirements**: `Math.ceil((2/5) * Trtt)` total CARRY parts
- **MOVE Ratio**: `MOVE ‚âà CARRY/2` (assumes roads for efficiency)
- **Dynamic Sizing**: 2-3 haulers based on energy capacity

### **Energy Flow Control**
- **Builder Allocation**: 10 energy/tick when construction needed
- **Upgrader Allocation**: Remaining energy (minimum 4 energy/tick)
- **Dynamic Balancing**: Adjusts based on room construction needs


## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture**

### **Single File Design**
- **`main.js`**: Complete bot implementation in one file
- **No external dependencies**: Pure JavaScript using Screeps API
- **Self-contained**: No user interaction required
- **Mathematical**: Implements throughput calculations for optimal efficiency

### **Optimized Energy Distribution System**
```
Sources ‚Üí Containers (near sources) ‚Üí Miners (parked, continuous)
Containers ‚Üí Haulers (optimized CARRY/MOVE) ‚Üí Spawn/Extensions
Spawn/Extensions ‚Üí Upgraders/Builders ‚Üí Controller/Construction
```

## üë• **Optimized Creep Roles**

### **Miner** (Replaces Harvester)
- **Purpose**: Continuous energy extraction from sources
- **Body**: `5W 1M` for maximum harvest rate
- **Behavior**: 
  - Assigned to specific sources
  - Parked on source containers
  - Continuous harvesting (no travel time)
  - Count: Fixed at 2 (one per source)

### **Hauler** (New Role)
- **Purpose**: Transport energy from source containers to base
- **Body**: Dynamically calculated based on distance and energy capacity
- **Behavior**:
  - Moves energy from source containers to spawn/extensions/storage
  - Prioritizes extensions/spawn over storage
  - Optimized CARRY/MOVE ratio for maximum throughput
- **Count**: 2-3 haulers (based on energy capacity and distance)


### **Upgrader**
- **Purpose**: Upgrade room controller (prevents downgrading)
- **Behavior**:
  - Gets energy from spawn/extensions/storage (haulers deliver here)
  - Prioritizes extensions/spawn over storage
  - Dynamic count based on available energy after builder needs


### **Builder**
- **Purpose**: Construct planned structures
- **Behavior**:
  - Gets energy from spawn/extensions/storage
  - Builds construction sites when available
  - Helps upgrade controller when no construction sites
  - Only spawned when construction work exists

## üèòÔ∏è **Enhanced Base Layout**

### **Centralized Design**
- Base positioned between spawn and controller
- Structures arranged in a 3-tile radius grid pattern
- Optimized for shortest travel distances


### **Planned Structures**
- **Extensions**: 10x (for more creep spawning capacity)
- **Towers**: 2x (for defense)
- **Storage**: Central energy storage
- **Terminal**: Resource trading
- **Link**: Energy transfer
- **Containers**: 
  - Near each source (for miner efficiency)
  - Near controller (for upgrader efficiency)
- **Roads**: 
  - From sources to base (hauler efficiency)
  - From base to controller (upgrader efficiency)

### **Smart Infrastructure**
- **Source Containers**: Adjacent to each source for miner deposits
- **Controller Container**: 2-3 tiles from controller for upgrader access
- **Road Planning**: Automatic road placement for improved travel efficiency

- **Smart Placement**: Only on plain/swamp terrain, avoiding walls

## ‚ö° **Pixel Earning Strategy**

### **CPU Management**
- **Monitor**: CPU bucket levels continuously
