# Mini-Screeps Bot - Throughput Optimized

A minimal, self-contained Screeps bot focused on **Pixel earning** with advanced throughput optimization for maximum room efficiency. This bot operates autonomously with **remote harvesting** support (v1.2), implementing mathematical throughput calculations for optimal energy flow across multiple rooms.

**Version**: 1.2.0 | **File**: `main.js` (~4000 lines) | **Dependencies**: None

## üéØ **Primary Goals**

1. **Pixel Generation**: Earn Pixels by using 10,000 CPU per tick (1 Pixel per 10,000 CPU)
2. **Base Maintenance**: Keep the room controller upgraded and maintain essential infrastructure
3. **Room Efficiency**: Maximize energy throughput using mathematical calculations
4. **CPU Optimization**: Minimize CPU usage through intelligent caching and optimization systems
5. **Competitive Performance**: Advanced features for efficient autonomous operation

## üßÆ **Throughput Mathematics**

### **Energy Production**
- **2 sources √ó 10 energy/tick = 20 energy/tick total**
- Each source produces 3000 energy over 300 ticks (regeneration cycle)
- Continuous harvesting with dedicated miners

### **Mining Optimization**
- **Miners**: `5W 1M` body (550 energy cost)
- **Harvest Rate**: 1 WORK = 2 energy/tick
- **Per-source Target**: 10 energy/tick (fully caps source)
- **Behavior**: Parked on source containers for continuous operation

### **Hauling Calculations**
 - **Dynamic Sizing**: Hauler counts are calculated from throughput math (carry parts per hauler ‚Üí energy/trip ‚Üí haulersNeeded). The spawning logic now ensures the hauler target respects the throughput-calculated minimum (prevents undersizing hauler population).

### **Energy Flow Control**
 - Gets energy from dropped energy first (prefers drops near the current build target or assigned source), then withdraws from nearby source containers to top up when near a source.
 - Builds construction sites when available
 - Helps upgrade controller when no construction sites
 - Spawn count: builders scale with construction backlog (1 base, up to 3 builders depending on number of construction sites)
- **Purpose**: Finds positions with good wall distance and controller/spawn access
- **Benefits**: Minimizes creep travel distances and maximizes base efficiency


## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture**

### **Single File Design**
- **`main.js`**: Complete bot implementation in one file
- **No external dependencies**: Pure JavaScript using Screeps API
- **Self-contained**: No user interaction required
